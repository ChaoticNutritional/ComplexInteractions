# It's ALIVE!
//[TODO] add picture of Monster under cloth

It's ALIVE! is a single-player VR experience in which you play the Doctor's Assistant. Your goal: to bring the doctor's creation to life!

## About

This project is about showcasing the things I've learned during my time at NYU Tandon School of Engineering's XR Development Bootcamp.

I created a brief game that focuses primarily on object interaction within VR using VR controllers.

On each playthrough, the player will be given a set of tasks randomly selected from a list of all possible tasks. These tasks are created using a task system that I developed for this project allowing future development to make use of this task system for more complex tasks.


## Getting Started

TODO: 
- Test dev build with MacOS
- Test usage on wireless VR devices

Development took place using Windows 10 OS devices.


### Pre-requisites (
- do I need anything? Any one-click downloads ie unity? Any specific ver?
#### In order to develop this game, you will need:
TODO: 
- Check editor version compatibility

Unity 2019.4.13
Universal Render Pipeline
Shader Graph
VFX Graph
Visual Studio 2019
A PCVR capable device (Oculus Rift/Quest 2/Vive/Index/etc)

(No testing has been conducted with Vive or Index as of yet but I'd like to tackle that soon!)
